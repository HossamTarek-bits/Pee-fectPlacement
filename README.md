### MenThinkSimulator: The Ultimate Urinal Selection Algorithm

This repo tackles the real algorithmic challenge: helping men find the most optimal urinal in any given lineup. It's based on the undeniable laws of "man logic," encoded as a greedy strategy to maximize comfort and minimize awkwardness.

Features:
- Calculates urinal scores based on occupied/empty neighbors.
- Supports edge cases like walls and full occupancy.
- Code so good, you'll never need to second-guess your spot again.

Because sometimes, solving lifeâ€™s biggest mysteries means starting small.
